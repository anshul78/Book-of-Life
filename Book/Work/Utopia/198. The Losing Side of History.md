# The Losing Side of History

The history of humanity is filled with a litany of appalling events, but our robust self-belief and underlying optimism mean that we’re inclined to trust, in many parts of the world at least, that society does eventually move in broadly the right direction, that progress can be made, errors weeded out and goodness one day triumph. The battle against evil and ignorance, though filled with lamentable reversals, inclines fitfully but steadily towards improvement.

There is – however – another view, what we might call the melancholy version of history, in which the focus is not so much on progress and gains, as on the many moments of the past in which something precious and important was forever extinguished, in which a civilisation that might have offered us ideas and attitudes we cannot any longer muster by ourselves did not make it through to modernity – not because of any inherent defect but because it was overpowered by a less gracious, more brutish, more bloodthirsty adversary – who then had the gall to sell their victory as an advance for humankind.

The melancholy mind is drawn to moments when history appears to confirm a thesis familiar from individual life: that the best do not typically win, that the prizes often go to the undeserving and that there can be a fateful connection between a nobility of spirit and an inability to summon up the reserves to defeat an aggressive and persistent enemy. In the ruins of old civilisations, the melancholy observe a moral tale about the fate of virtue and honour in a heedless world. It may not always be sound or subtle history; it can be very apt psychology.

The melancholy may, for example, turn their thoughts to Britain at the start of the fifth century. There were symmetrically laid out towns in Verulamium (St Albans), Lindum (Lincoln) and Eboracum (York). There were limestone and marble baths at Aquae Sulis. Shops sold amphorae filled with olive oil from southern Spain and wine from Gaul; you could buy salted fish from Greece and preserved olives from Sicily. There was a high degree of order and some justice. And then in a few short years, four centuries of Roman rule in Britain came to a sorry end. The German tribes moved forwards irresistibly across the Rhine, politics in Rome grew especially treacherous and the legions were abruptly summoned back to the center. In villas around the country, there was no time to make adequate preparations. Marauding bands of Saxons, Picts and Scotti looted and destroyed everything in sight. Much was laid to waste without any identifiable benefit to the invaders, perhaps simply to lessen their intimidation in the face of so much refinement. Anyone identified with Roman rule was at risk. In the chaos, fleeing families buried valuables in their gardens, in the vain hope that Rome might one day recover and they would be able to return and restart their lives. Near the village of Hoxne in Suffolk, a panicked family buried their kitchenware, including a little silver pepper pot in the shape of an elegantly-coiffed woman; inside it was a turning disc for grinding seeds (that would have been brought to East Anglia from southern India) and perforations for dispensing pepper at different rates.

A woman added a golden necklace that might have been a gift from her mother and that she would, in more peaceful days, have worn on social occasions, perhaps during the celebrations to the goddess Fortuna in May or the Festival of Neptune in July. Looking at the finely-wrought closing mechanism, one imagines her fingers reaching around to clasp it to her neck, unselfconsciously and naturally – as she had so many times before – just as one shudders to imagine her eventual fate once the violence had set in, maybe surviving a few desperate years trembling in an Essex forest or slain and thrown into an unmarked ditch by a vengeful Saxon warrior.

There were to be no hot baths again in Britain for 12 centuries and no classical buildings for 1235 years. People stopped using money and went back to bartering; the roads fell into disrepair, the towns emptied. Four storey stone buildings with porticos and Corinthian columns gave way to thatched wooden huts.

One imagines how different it could have been if Roman rule had been able to unwind more gradually, with less rage and violence on the part of the conquerors. Had things worked out otherwise, people might have been reading Ovid and Seneca in Pons Aelius (Newcastle) in the sixth century or taking hot baths under Doric arches in Durocornovium (Swindon) in the reign of King Offa of Mercia in the eighth century; there would have been no Dark Ages and no thousand year wait for a Renaissance. Christianity might not have needed to impose itself with such savagery. In Rome, there would have been no impulse to smash up the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the middle of the Forum – and then crudely insert a temple to Christ inside and call it progress.

One can lament the innocents and the ideas, the faiths and the arts that have vanished at the hands of a few victorious nations. One can daydream about how different the Americas would have been if that canny, fierce Spanish adventurer Hernan Cortes had been shipwrecked off Cuba in the late summer of 1519 and had not had the chance to butcher his way to the capital of the Aztec Empire, Tenochtitlan, a city of gardens and lakes, home to half a million inhabitants, the largest conurbation in the world at that time, and one of its most educated and decorous, filled with botanical gardens, arenas for playing ullamaliztli games (with special rubber balls), ordered residential districts and bustling markets selling slabs of dark chocolate, sweet cornbread, multicoloured parrots and the skins of jaguars. One wishes that this civilisation had managed to spend longer undisturbed under the rule of the Emperor Moctezuma and his heirs, and so been able to acquire the horses, steel swords and biological immunity required to meet the West on its terms – so that Tenochtitlan might now be one of the great urban tapestries of the world, the Paris or Kyoto of Mesoamerica, its culture harmonised with modernity, reachable by a fleet of advanced jetliners based at Etzalcualiztli International Airport and which would have painted on their tails (in a nostalgic throwback respected by modern Aztecs in the same way an American might think of Abraham Lincoln) with a rendering of Huitzilopochtli, father of the nation and God of the Sun.

One might likewise wish that the Nasrid dynasty that controlled the Emirate of Granada had not met such a definitive end in 1492; that Muhammad XII could have brokered a deal with Queen Isabella I of Castile and that this enlightened nation, administered from the intricately decorated chambers of the Alhambra Palace, could have continued to be a center of learning, a home for multiple faiths and a center for mathematics and poetry. One might no less wish that the Republic of Venice could have held out against the French in 1797 and, rather than becoming a quaint historical curiosity, could have remained a dynamic independent city state, dedicated to business and the arts, the Singapore of the Adriatic, with its logo, the lion of St Mark, proudly emblazoned on the sides of its electric ships and online trading portals.

The melancholy mind appreciates that it isn’t the best, the cleverest or the most deserving who invariably win; it tends to be those most dedicated to slaughter, rule-bending and aggression – and (in many cases) those who have had the good fortune to live in a region with large tameable mammals to ride into battle and a two hundred year head start in making gunpowder. Beneath a triumphalist narration of history, a far sadder idea emerges: that one can be noble and yet defeated. But also, and more hopefully, that there can be such a thing as an honourable failure, a failure which demonstrates greater virtues of character than success, because it is founded on unusual reserves of honesty, imagination and tolerance. We have plenty to learn from some of the so-called ‘losers’ of history, not so much about realpolitik and power play, as about the sort of lives it might be truly civilised to be able to lead.
