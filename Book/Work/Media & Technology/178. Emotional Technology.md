It’s always exciting to think about what kinds of technology are going to be coming to us in the future. By extrapolating from current trends, we can make some good guesses about some of the astonishing inventions that are going to be around 40 or 50 years from now. Yet, when we think of the technology of the future, too often we restrict our imagination to particular areas: to&nbsp;gadgets that will make us go faster. But some of the truly exciting developments will be around gadgets that help us with the tricky aspects of our emotional lives.
