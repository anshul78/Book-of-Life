# What’s Wrong with the Media

[![Newspaper Reader](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5354244475_f06bc938c7_z.jpg)](http://www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5354244475_f06bc938c7_z.jpg)

We are likely to have grown up thinking that the mainstream media was our friend. The common sense, natural judge of everything that matters and is important and a reliable guide to existence. So why, after spending so long with it, are we generally so overloaded, confused and oddly unfocused on the stuff that really matters?
