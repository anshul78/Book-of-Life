# First World Problems

[![10333686125_4f7c035d29_z](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/10333686125_4f7c035d29_z.jpg)](http://www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/10333686125_4f7c035d29_z.jpg)

We’ve grown used to belittling things that don’t happen to be important to us right now with the powerful term, ‘first world problem’. This kind of tough-minded response is understandable but a bit counterproductive. Just because an issue isn’t connected to life or death, doesn’t mean it doesn’t cause genuine pain or isn’t worth thinking about. A problem can be important without being life-threatening. Moreover, we should be excited by trying to solve the most advanced problems out there.
