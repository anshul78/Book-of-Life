# The Life House

The School of Life is a global organisation committed to emotional education. Our headquarters are in some of the world’s major urban centres: London, Paris, Amsterdam, Melbourne, Seoul, Istanbul… &nbsp;But we have always been interested in helping&nbsp;our audiences find some of the peace of mind once offered by isolated rural monasteries.

**It was with this in mind that we bought a piece of land in a deserted valley in central Wales and, with the help of the British architect John Pawson, built a** &nbsp;secular ‘monastery’ we call THE LIFE HOUSE.

Visitors are invited to spend week-long formal retreats &nbsp;at the Life House – taking part&nbsp;in a variety of indoor and outdoor therapeutic exercises. One of the central experiences of The Life House is a Contemplation Chamber buried in the hillside, a bare room in which to empty the mind and become responsive to long suppressed thoughts and associations.

On the ground, on a massive piece of granite, is inscribed a quotation from Pascal: ‘All of man’s unhappiness is caused by his inability to stay quietly in a room by himself.’

Three bedrooms follow, each dedicated to one of the central ways in which humans have traditionally searched for calm.

There is a Music Bedroom, with state of the art equipment and a curated selection of music to bring calm and perspective to the soul.

Next comes the Library Bedroom, with an array of books that promote introspection, reconciliation and a sense of serenity.

Lastly there is the Bathing Bedroom, with a sunken tub that gives out onto the Welsh valley beyond.

We believe that architecture has a fundamental role to play in mental health and well-being. The Life House is an embodiment of our commitment to the education of the spirit.
