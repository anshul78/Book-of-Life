Philosophy begins in the Ancient World where it is immediately thought of as a highly practical discipline close to what we would nowadays think of as psychotherapy. One goes to see a philosopher to clear up a variety of emotional and intellectual confusions. The job of being a philosopher becomes extremely prestigious. Different schools of philosophy form, each one claiming a better grasp on the ingredients of true calm and fulfilment than the next. Here are the four great strands of Ancient Greek philosophy:

**1. Plato**
