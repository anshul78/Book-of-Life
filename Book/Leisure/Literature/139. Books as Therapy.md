[![1601055962_cc262c3c2b_z](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1601055962_cc262c3c2b_z.jpg)](http://www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1601055962_cc262c3c2b_z.jpg)

We have a general sense that books can teach us things, make us value our everyday lives and even shape the way we think. But&nbsp;the question of which books we should read, not just for knowledge or entertainment, but for therapeutic potential, is rarely taken up.

As such, we have have built a microsite to act as a guide to how reading might fit into – and improve – our daily lives. To find out which author might make you become a better lover, or deal with an annoying colleague, visit:&nbsp;[www.booksastherapy.com](http://www.booksastherapy.com/)
