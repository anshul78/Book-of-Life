It’s easy to get stuck in a position of not having much sex. Often we stop trying because of something that goes a bit wrong, perhaps there were some nasty arguments or moments of impotence&nbsp;or some awkwardness or discomfort. But what’s worse is that failure in the past puts us off from ever really trying again. We become avoidant or shy around the whole topic and then the situation gets really fraught because a lack of physical contact quickly destroys trust and intimacy.
