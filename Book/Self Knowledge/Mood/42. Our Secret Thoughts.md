# Our Secret Thoughts

[![2544275159_cff717a23a_z](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2544275159_cff717a23a_z.jpg)](http://www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2544275159_cff717a23a_z.jpg)

We apparently live in an age of honesty and disclosure but in truth most of what we are remains unacceptable and disguised to the world. We simply cannot show too much of our real natures and retain the affections of others. As a result, we’re lonely with parts of our characters we simply don’t hear anyone else admitting to. One of the functions of art is to break that loneliness, by taking us into the secret unmentioned thoughts with dignity and occasional humor.

The films below gently show us that in our hearts, almost all of us are rather more envious, internet addicted, romantic and greedy than we are ever able to let on.
